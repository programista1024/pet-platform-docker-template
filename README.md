# 🐾 Pet Platform – Docker Academy Template

This repository is a **template project** designed for Docker education and modular application development. It is structured as a multi-stage roadmap, progressively introducing more complex services and technologies — from simple PHP and MySQL setups to Django, React, microservices, and Kubernetes.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

The goal of this project is to:

- Teach Docker and container-based architecture step by step
- Guide developers through realistic business scenarios
- Use domain-driven modularization and scalable architecture
- Support multiple technologies and stacks (PHP, Django, React, etc.)

---

## 🧠 Business Concept

This is a **model application** for a pet services platform, including:

- 🩺 Veterinary Services
- ✂️ Grooming Services
- 🏨 Pet Hotel
- 🚶 Walker Booking
- 🐶 Animal Shelter Search
- 👤 User Authentication
- 🎨 Unified Frontend
